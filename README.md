- App Idea
I'd like to build an app that recommends food to eat because my friends and I are very indecisive about where to go. It would be like Yelp and Beli where you can see the public's and your friends' reviews. I would like to implement a feed option where you can also see reels or posts about food. It would also be cool in the future if you could collect cute characters at restaurants like Pokemon Go.   
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
